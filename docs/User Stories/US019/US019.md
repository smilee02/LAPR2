# US 019 - NHS daily reports

## 1. Requirements Engineering

In this US, it is required to have a report ready to be sent every day at the same hour (6:00 am).


### 1.1. User Story Description

The Many Labs company wants to send to the NHS daily reports of Covid-19 
data, including the number of observed values and estimated values. Reports should be 
generated automatically with historical data and must be sent every day at 6:00 am.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

*Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications.*

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

The report should include day and week (observed and estimated) values, the regression model used to estimate each value, R(SLR), R2 and R2 adjusted for SLR and MLR, hypothesis tests for regression coefficients significance model with Anova. Simple linear and multilinear regression models can be used to compute the estimates and corresponding confidence intervals. When the system is configured to use the simple linear regression model, the 
performance of each model should be used to select the best model (the one that uses the number of tests realized or the one that uses the mean age as independent variable). The best model will be used to make the estimated/expected values that will be send to NHS. The interval of dates to fit the regression model and the number of historical points (number of days and number of weeks) must be defined through a configuration file. 
The system should send the report using the NHS API (available in moodle).

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Identify here any found out dependency to other US and/or requirements.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

*Identity here the data to be inputted by the system actor as well as the output data that the system have/needs to present in order to properly support the actor actions. Regarding the inputted data, it is suggested to distinguish between typed data and selected data (e.g. from a list)*


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements ; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.* 


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 

 @Test
    void testConvertFromDateToString() {
        Date date = new Date(2001-1900, 2-1 , 5);
        String expresult = "05/02/2001";
        String result = store.convertFromDateToString(date);
        assertEquals(expresult,result);
    }

        List<Double> list = Arrays.asList(1.4, 2.5, 3.6, 4.7);
        double[] expresult = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        Object[] result = list.toArray();
        assertNotEquals(expresult, result);

 @Test
    void calculateAge() {
        Date date = new Date(2020 - 1900, 3 - 1, 1);
        double realValue = store.calculateAge(store.convertFromDateToString(date));
        double expectedValue = 1.0;
        assertEquals(expectedValue, realValue);

Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*
