###**Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**###

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

+ **_Medical Lab Technician_** collects **_Sample_**
+ **_Medical Lab Technician_** checks **_Results_**
+ **_Clinical Chemestry Technologist_** performs **_Chemical Analysis_**
+ **_Specialist Doctor_** makes **_Diagnosis_**
+ **_Specialist Doctor_** writes **_Report_**
+ **_Specialist Doctor_** checks **_Results_**
+ **_Laboratory Coordinator_** validates **_Report_**
+ **_Laboratory Coordinator_** validates **_Results_**
+ **_Laboratory Coordinator_** checks **_Results_**
+ **_Sample_** are sent to **_Chemical Laboratory_**
+ **_Sample_** used for **_Test_**
+ **_Chemical Analysis_** analysed by **_Specialist Doctor_**
+ **_Chemical Analysis_** performed in **_Chemical Laboratory_**
+ **_Chemical Analysis_** generates **_Results_**
+ **_Chemical Laboratory_** is part of **_Laboratories_**
+ **_Company_** generates **_Daily Reports_**
+ **_Company_** owns **_Laboratories_**
+ **_Test_** made by **_Laboratories_**
+ **_Test_** requested by **_Client_**
+ **_Blood Test_** is part of **_Test_**
+ **_Covid Test_** is part of **_Test_**
+ **_Diagnosis_** will be delivered to **_Client_**
+ **_Receptionist_** register **Client**
+ **_Report_** delivered **Client**
+ **_Lab Order_** is related **Client**
+ **_Client_** checks **Results**
